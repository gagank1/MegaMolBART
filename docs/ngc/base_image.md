## What is MegaMolBART?

[MegaMolBART](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:clara:megamolbart) is a model that understands chemistry and can be used for a variety of cheminformatics applications in drug discovery. The embeddings from its encoder can be used as features for predictive models. Alternatively, the encoder and decoder can be used together to generate novel molecules by sampling the model's embedding space.
